===========
Release 0.5
===========

* various cosmetic changes in the terminal
* garbage collector mode, to collect also all unfitted spikes, per channel
* complete restructuration of the I/O such that the code can now handle multiple file formats
* because of the file format, slight restructuration of the parameter files
* N_t and radius have been moved to the [detection] section, more consistent
* addition of an explicit file_format parameter in the [data] section
* every file format may have its own parameters, see documentation for details
* can now work natively with open ephys data files (.openephys)
* can now work natively with MCD data files (.mcd) [using neuroshare]
* can now work natively with Kwik (KWD) data files (.kwd)
* can now work natively with NeuroDataWithoutBorders files (.nwb)
* can now work natively with any HDF5-like structure data files (.h5)
* can now work natively with Arf data files (.arf)
* can now work natively with 3Brain data files (.brw)
* can still work natively with raw binary files with/without headers :)
* faster IO for raw binary files
* refactoring of the exports during multi-file/preview/benchmark: everything is now handled in raw binary
* fix a bug with the size of the safety time parameter during whitening and clustering
* internal refactoring to ease interaction with new file formats and readibility
* all the interactions with the parameters are now done in the circus/shared/parser.py file
* all the interactions with the probe are now done in the circus/shared/probes.py file
* display the electrode number in the preview/result GUI



=============
Release 0.4.3
=============

* cosmetic changes in the terminal
* automatic reduction of chunk sizes for high density probes (N_e > 500) to save memory



=============
Release 0.4.2
=============

* fix a bug in the test suite
* fix a bug in python GUI for non integer thresholds
* fix a bug with output strings in python3
* fix a bug to kill processes in windows from the launcher
* fix graphical issues in the launcher and python3
* colors are now present also in python3
* finer control of the amplitudes with the dispersion parameter
* finer control of the cut off frequencies during the filtering
* the smart search mode is now back, with a simple True/False flag. Use it for long or noisy recordings
* optimizations in the smart search mode, now implementing a rejection method based on amplitudes
* show the mean amplitude over time in the MATLAB GUI
* MATLAB is automatically closed when closing the MATLAB GUI
* mean rate is now displayed in the MATLAB GUI, for new datasets only
* spike times are now saved as uint32, for new datasets only
* various fixes in the docs
* improvements when peak detection is set on "both"
* message about cc_merge for low density probes
* message about smart search for long recordings
* various cosmetic changes
* add a conda app for anaconda navigator


=============
Release 0.4.1
=============

* fix a bug for converting millions of PCs to phy, getting rid of MPI limitation to int32
* fix bugs with install on Windows 10, forcing int64 while default is int32 even on 64bits platforms
* improved errors messages if wrong MCS headers are used
* Various cosmetic changes
