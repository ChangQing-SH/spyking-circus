=============
Release 0.4.2
=============

* fix a bug in the test suite
* fix a bug in python GUI for non integer thresholds
* finer control of the amplitudes with the dispersion parameter
* finer control of the cut off frequencies during the filtering
* the smart search mode is now back, with a simple True/False flag. Use it for long or noisy recordings
* optimizations in the smart search mode, now implementing a rejection method based on amplitudes
* show the mean amplitude over time in the MATLAB GUI
* MATLAB is automatically closed when closing the MATLAB GUI
* mean rate is now displayed in the MATLAB GUI, for new datasets only
* spike times are now saved as uint32, for new datasets only
* various fixed in the docs
* improvements for when peak detection is set on "both"


=============
Release 0.4.1
=============

* fix a bug for converting millions of PCs to phy, getting rid of MPI limitation to int32
* fix bugs with install on Windows 10, forcing int64 while default is int32 even on 64bits platforms
* improved errors messages if wrong MCS headers are used
* Various cosmetic changes
