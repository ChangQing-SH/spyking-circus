Release notes
=============

Spyking CIRCUS 0.1
------------------

This is the first alpha release of the SpyKING CIRCUS, a new approach to the
problem of spike sorting. The code is based on a smart clustering with
subsampling, and a greedy template matching approach, such that it can
resolve the problem of overlapping spikes.
