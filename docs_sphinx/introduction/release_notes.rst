Release notes
=============

Spyking CIRCUS 0.1
------------------

This is the first alpha release of the SpyKING CIRCUS, a new approach to the
problem of spike sorting. The code is based on a smart clustering with
sub sampling, and a greedy template matching approach, such that it can
resolve the problem of overlapping spikes.

.. warning::

    Because this is an alpha version, the code may evolve. Even if results are or should be correct, we can expect some more optimizations in a near future, based on feedbacks obtained on multiple datasets. If you spot some problems with the results, please be in touch with pierre.yger@inserm.fr
