The SpyKING CIRCUS is a massively parallel code to perform spike sorting on large extra-cellular recordings. Using a smart clustering and a greedy template matching approach, the code can solve the problem of overlapping spikes, and has been tested both for *in vitro* and *in vivo* data. Details should be published soon.
